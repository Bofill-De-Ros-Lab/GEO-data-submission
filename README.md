# GEO-data-submission

For GEO submission we will need:

1. Original raw data (fastq.gz). As obtained from the sequencing facility or equipment.
1.1 Md5sum numbers for each file.

2. Processed files. GEO requires the closest processed files to what is used for analysis for each original raw data file. Usually more processed than regular bam/bai files.
2.1 Md5sum numbers for each file.

3. Completed metadata worksheet. Check the latest version of their template, it keeps changing.
